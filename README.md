Reflection: Industry Talk and Industry Visit：

The industry talk and industry visit helped me better understand how information technology is applied in real industrial environments. From the PPG industry talk, I learned how large companies use data analytics, cloud infrastructure, and SAP enterprise systems to support global operations and improve efficiency. The speakers showed that IT is not only about programming, but also about system integration, planning, and supporting business decisions.
During the industrial visit to Johor Port, I was able to see how ICT systems are used in daily port operations. Systems such as JPBI, ERP, and PAMS play an important role in managing logistics, security, and workflow. I also learned that technology can improve workplace safety by reducing human involvement in dangerous tasks. This visit helped me see the connection between what we learn in class and real-world applications.
Overall, these activities increased my awareness of the importance of both technical skills and soft skills such as communication and adaptability. They motivated me to continue learning new technologies and better prepare myself for future industry challenges.

Reflection: PC Assemble (Lab)：

The PC assemble lab helped me understand computer hardware through hands-on practice. By assembling a computer step by step, I learned the functions of key components such as the motherboard, CPU, RAM, storage devices, and power supply, and how they work together as a complete system. This lab made the hardware concepts taught in lectures much clearer.
During the lab session, I also learned the importance of following proper procedures and handling components carefully to avoid damage. Troubleshooting small issues during assembly improved my problem-solving skills and patience. Overall, this activity increased my confidence in working with computer hardware and helped me better understand the role of hardware in information systems.

Reflection: Design Thinking：

The design thinking project helped me understand how to solve problems from the users’ perspective instead of focusing only on technical solutions. Through surveys, interviews, and discussions, I learned that many students face issues such as transaction risk, lack of trust, and unclear information when using social media for second-hand trading. This made me realize the importance of clearly defining the problem before designing a system.
By following the design thinking steps, I learned to think in a structured way, from identifying user needs to developing and testing a prototype. Working in a group also improved my communication and teamwork skills, as we needed to share ideas and make decisions together. Overall, this project showed me that effective system design requires understanding users, building trust, and ensuring usability. This experience will be useful for my future studies and real-world projects.
